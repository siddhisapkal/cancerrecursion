ðŸ§  Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction using Machine Learning
This project applies machine learning algorithms to predict thyroid cancer recurrence based on patient medical records. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering (especially TNM stage encoding), visualization, model training (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree), hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
filtered_thyroid_data.csv

Contains patient data such as Age, Gender, TNM stage, Risk, and whether cancer recurred (Recurred column - target variable).

ðŸš€ Project Structure
ðŸ”„ Data Preprocessing
